# Marketing Analytics Methodology
## Facebook Ads Performance Analysis & ML Training Data Preparation

### Project Overview
This project demonstrates end-to-end data processing and machine learning dataset preparation using real Facebook Ads campaign data. The methodology combines workflow automation with Python-based statistical analysis to create production-ready training data for performance prediction models.

### Data Source
- **Dataset**: 951 Facebook ad campaigns from Media Buyer Bridge internship
- **Time Period**: Multiple campaign periods across different ad sets
- **Data Quality**: Real-world marketing data with complete performance metrics
- **Privacy**: Campaign names anonymized for portfolio presentation

### Automated Data Processing Pipeline

#### 1. Data Ingestion (n8n Workflow)
- **Source**: Google Sheets integration with Facebook Ads Manager exports
- **Format**: CSV files with campaign-level performance metrics
- **Automation**: Scheduled data pulls and processing via n8n workflows

#### 2. Feature Engineering
**Calculated Metrics**:
- Click-Through Rate (CTR) = (Clicks / Impressions) × 100
- Cost Per Acquisition (CPA) = Spend / Conversions
- Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) = Revenue / Spend
- Cost Per Mille (CPM) = (Spend / Impressions) × 1000

**Feature Set**:
- **Numeric Features**: CTR, CPA, ROAS, CPM, Impressions, Clicks, Spend, Conversions
- **Categorical Features**: Campaign Name, Ad Set Budget Type, Result Indicator
- **Derived Features**: Performance scores and confidence ratings

#### 3. Performance Annotation Algorithm
**Scoring System** (0-100 points):
- **CTR Component** (0-40 points):
  - >3% = 40 points
  - 2-3% = 30 points
  - 1-2% = 20 points
  - 0.5-1% = 10 points
  - <0.5% = 0 points

- **CPA Component** (0-30 points):
  - <$20 = 30 points
  - $20-40 = 20 points
  - $40-60 = 10 points
  - >$60 = 0 points

- **ROAS Component** (0-30 points):
  - >4x = 30 points
  - 3-4x = 20 points
  - 2-3x = 10 points
  - <2x = 0 points

**Performance Labels**:
- **High Performance**: ≥70 points (101 campaigns, 10.6%)
- **Medium Performance**: 40-69 points (45 campaigns, 4.7%)
- **Low Performance**: <40 points (805 campaigns, 84.6%)

#### 4. Quality Validation
**Annotation Confidence**: 0.85-0.9 based on metric completeness
**Data Completeness**: 100% complete records (no missing values)
**Label Distribution**: Validated against business expectations
**Outlier Detection**: Statistical analysis for data quality assurance

### Machine Learning Dataset Format

#### Metadata Structure
```json
{
  "dataset_name": "facebook_ads_performance_training",
  "total_samples": 951,
  "features": {
    "numeric": ["ctr", "cpa", "roas", "cpm", "impressions", "clicks", "spend", "conversions"],
    "categorical": ["campaign_name", "ad_set_budget_type", "result_indicator"]
  },
  "target": "performance_label",
  "annotation_method": "rule_based_with_scoring"
}
```

#### Sample Format
Each training sample includes:
- **Unique ID**: Campaign identifier
- **Features**: Numeric and categorical performance metrics
- **Label**: Performance classification (high/medium/low)
- **Confidence Score**: Annotation reliability (0.85-0.9)
- **Metadata**: Timestamp, data source flags, row numbers

### Statistical Analysis

#### Key Findings
- **High performers achieve 62% higher CTR** (3.4% vs 2.1%)
- **High performers deliver 150% better ROAS** (4.7x vs 1.9x)
- **High performers reduce CPA by 95%** ($3.85 vs $99.90)

#### Feature Correlations
- Strong positive correlation between CTR and ROAS (r=0.75)
- Negative correlation between CPA and performance labels (r=-0.68)
- Campaign type shows significant impact on performance distribution

### Tools and Technologies

#### Automation Stack
- **n8n**: Workflow automation and data processing
- **Google Sheets**: Data storage and collaboration
- **JavaScript**: Custom calculation logic within n8n

#### Analysis Stack
- **Python**: Primary analysis language
- **pandas**: Data manipulation and aggregation
- **matplotlib/seaborn**: Statistical visualization

### Validation and Quality Assurance

#### Data Quality Checks
1. **Completeness**: Verified all 951 records have complete feature sets
2. **Consistency**: Validated calculation accuracy across metrics
3. **Distribution**: Confirmed label balance aligns with business expectations
4. **Outliers**: Identified and validated extreme values in context

#### Annotation Validation
1. **Rule Consistency**: Applied scoring algorithm uniformly across dataset
2. **Edge Case Handling**: Defined clear boundaries for borderline cases
3. **Confidence Scoring**: Assigned reliability metrics to each annotation
4. **Business Logic**: Validated annotations against marketing domain knowledge

### Applications and Use Cases
